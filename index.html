      <h3>Nice to Meet You!</h3>
      <p>Hi, I'm Robin. I work in GIS at the County of Frontenac. I have two years of experience in GIS and am very comfortable with
        ESRI products. I'm also a self-taught front-end web developer with a passion for coding. I'm always excited to learn from others,
        so feel free to reach out.
      </p>
      <p>Beyond GIS and web dev, I'm interested in entrepreneurship, gardening, weightlifting, investment, and more! </p>

        <h3>Experience at a Glance</h3>
          <div class="explist">
            <p>Where to start? I have multiple years of experience in GIS. I currently work at the County of Frontenac in the field. I have also built my computer science and web development skills with the hopes of combining my interests into being a gis web developer. 
            </p>
              
            <p> 
              Beyond my tech skills, I am a people person and have worked in several client-centric roles, allowing me to understand the importance of effective communication. In project based situations, hard skills are important, but they are useless if we cannot understand what the client wants in the first place. I deliberately took courses such as public presentation, public relations, entrepreneurship, and more. I love GIS, but my interest in understanding what makes people tick allows me to be versatile and creative.
